# Vulnerability Management App

This console-based App manages your vulnerabilites. With the App, you can request exploits from exploit-db.com and CVE's (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) from NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). The App uses a MongoDB for managing requests and viewing entries. 

## Installation

After installing the relevant packages and dependencies, you can start the App with starting the Sequencer in sequence.py.
```bash
python sequence.py
```

## Task 1 - UML

Find UML diagrams in /docu/UML

https://github.com/kerneee/vulnerability_app/tree/main/docu/UML

## Task 2 - DDD

Find DDD overview /docu/DDD

https://github.com/kerneee/vulnerability_app/tree/main/docu/DDD


## Task 3 Metrics

Find Sonarcube report under https://github.com/kerneee/vulnerability_app/tree/main/docu/Sonarcube

## Task 4 - Clean Code Development

Find documentation and Clean Code Cheat Sheet under https://github.com/kerneee/vulnerability_app/tree/main/docu/Clean_Code_Development

## Task 5 - Build Management

Added pybuilder Build Managment, which builds Python, processes Unit and Flake Tests and checks the test coverage. See build details in https://github.com/kerneee/vulnerability_app/tree/main/setup.py and https://github.com/kerneee/vulnerability_app/tree/main/build.py.

## Task 6 - Unit Tests

You can find Unit Tests, which are implemented with pytest in src/tests. The unit tests checking for the exploit and cve module the structure of the data, as well as requests which are made to exploit-db.com and nvd.nist.gov. The unit tests for the sequencer checks different input and outputs. The unit tests are part of the CD-Pipeline in GitHub Actions and are executed every push to the repository.

## Task 7 - Continuous Delivery 

GitHub Actions is used as CD-Pipeline for the project. You can find the config in .github/workflows/start.yaml. The pipeline starts every repository push. In the first step it sets up Python 3.7 on the latest Ubuntu. After that it installs all dependencies as well as pytest and flake8. After that it executes flake8 for general code quality checks. After that the Pipeline executes the Unit Tests descriped under point 6.

## Task 8 - IDE

You can find the choice of IDE under https://github.com/kerneee/vulnerability_app/tree/main/docu/IDE

## Task 9 - DSL 

You can find the DSL demo in https://github.com/kerneee/vulnerability_app/tree/main/src/exploit.py and the documentation under https://github.com/kerneee/vulnerability_app/tree/main/docu/DSL

## Task 10 - Functional Programming
You can find documentation to FP under https://github.com/kerneee/vulnerability_app/tree/main/docu/FP.
