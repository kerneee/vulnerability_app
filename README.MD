# Vulnerability Management App

This console-based App manages your vulnerabilites. With the App, you can request exploits from exploit-db.com and CVE's (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) from NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). The App uses a MongoDB for managing requests and viewing entries. 

## Installation

After installing the relevant packages and dependencies, you can start the App with starting the Sequencer in sequence.py.
```bash
python sequence.py
```
