- only final data structure
    * The data structure of the program is immutable and the program flow declarative. Depending on the user input and the user's choice, data is prepared and presented. The different methods are only used to manage the data flow. The data structure used in the program is given by the standardised data structure from the CVE and the Exploits, which are collected in the database. 
- side effect free functions
    * the whole program uses only side effect free functions
    * there is no function, which changes values of local variables
    * you can find a good example in cve.py: All methods of the class Cve accept return values of other functions and retur new values, which are used in further functions as parameters. They do not change any local value. The class does not use any local variables, which are changed by functions. You can see the same in exploit.py for the class Exploit.

- the use of higher-order functions
    * the method cve_to_db in cve.py is an example for the use of higher-order functions. It calls the function request_cve_data, which returns a filepath, which is used in function parse_cve_data. This method again returns the database operations, which are inserted into the db with the method insert_into_db. You can find a smaller example in exploit_to_db in exploit.py.

- functions as parameters and return values
    * see the examples above.

- closure / anonymous functions
    * see in cve.py the use of two combinations of map and lambda to filter result arrays.
    * https://github.com/kerneee/vulnerability_app/blob/main/src/cve.py
    ```python
        results = map(lambda x: x if x is not None else None, results)
        results = map(lambda x: x if isinstance(x, dict) else {x}, results)
    ```

- use of recursion
    * recursion is beside the mentioned characteristics an important part of functional programming. The class Sequencer in sequence.py manages the programm flow depending on the user's choice and input. The function sequence is a side effect free function, which manages the programming flow recursive.
